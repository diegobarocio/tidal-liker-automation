## üß† Why I Made This

I had thousands of songs spread across different playlists and wanted to easily shuffle them all from my ‚ÄúLiked‚Äù tracks. Tidal didn‚Äôt offer a native way to bulk-like songs ‚Äî so I built my own.

This script helped me get it done instantly.

- Click it and go to the **Headers** tab

### 4. Get Your Token  
In the **Request Headers**, find a line like this: authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiJ2OU1G...


Copy everything **after** `Bearer` ‚Üí that‚Äôs your `TOKEN`.
